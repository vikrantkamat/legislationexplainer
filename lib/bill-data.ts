This Act may be cited as the "Preventing PFAS Runoff at Airports Act".

Section 2. Findings.
Congress finds the following:
(1) Per- and polyfluoroalkyl substances (PFAS) are a group of man-made chemicals that have been manufactured and used in a variety of industries since the 1940s.
(2) PFAS are found in many consumer products, including food packaging, household cleaners, nonstick cookware, stain-resistant fabrics, and firefighting foam.
(3) PFAS are known as "forever chemicals" because they do not break down in the environment and can accumulate in the human body over time.
(4) Exposure to certain PFAS may be linked to harmful health effects in humans and animals.
(5) Firefighting foam containing PFAS has been used at airports for emergency response and training.
(6) When firefighting foam containing PFAS is used at airports, it can contaminate nearby soil, surface water, and groundwater.
(7) Many airports lack systems to contain, capture, and properly dispose of firefighting foam containing PFAS.
(8) The Federal Aviation Administration requires airports to use firefighting foam that meets certain performance standards, which has historically required the use of foam containing PFAS.
(9) The FAA Reauthorization Act of 2018 directed the FAA to allow airports to use firefighting foam that does not contain PFAS.
